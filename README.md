# TrafficSurveillanceSystem
The traffic surveillance system counts the number of vehicles in the traffic and adjusts the signal timers dynamically. It features a GUI which can be used to keep track of data and control timers manually.

This project was part of the "Project" at Gujarat Technological University.
